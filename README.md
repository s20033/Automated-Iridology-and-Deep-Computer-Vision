# Automated-Iridology-and-Deep-Computer-Vision
Iridology is the method of diagnosis of potential health conditions by examining the Iris (color area of eye). It is very well-known technique of disease diagnosis among practitioner of naturopathy. It is very ancient practice believed to be 1000s years old, since we find it mentioned in Ayurvedic literatures as well.  Iridology was first popularized by Dr. Ignatz Von Peczley in 1881. Since many scholars are working in this very fascinating field of disease diagnosis.  The practice is more commonplace in Europe and growing gradually in other part of world. A study involving 800,000 patients discovered that Iridology can be an effective form of diagnosis in as many as 85% of cases.  Iridology is all about recognizing and identifying patterns in nerve bundles knowns as trabeculae which are pervasive in the iris. These nerves display information relayed by the oculomotor nerve from various organs and systems in the body to give an indication of their state of health. However, examining a pattern of nerves in iris is very sensitive job, leaving the chance for human to have errors. This is where, Automated Iris recognition and Deep Computer vision plays itâ€™s significant role.
